A fully MVC based re-implementation of GtkScrollbar
===================================================

This project was inspired by Kris' talk about the MVC pattern in the Lanedo
apres-conference after FOSDEM 2010.


Class Overview:

 + GObject
   + GInitiallyUnowned
     + GtkObject
     | + GtkWidget
     |   + GtkMvcAdaptor: a GtkWidget that embeds a GtkMvcView/GtkMvcController
     |     into a GtkContainer (so we have a proper migration path)
     + GtkMvcDefaultController: a noop controller implementation
     + GtkMvcDefaultView: an object providing sane defaults for implementing new views
     | + GtkMvcButtonView: the view for the button
     | + GtkMvcScrollView: the view for the scrollbar implementation
     + GtkMvcScrollController: the controller for the scrollbar implementation
     + GtkMvcScrollModel: the model for the scrollbar implementation
 + GTypeInterface
   + GtkMvcController: the interface resembling the controllers
   + GtkMvcView: the interface resembling the views
